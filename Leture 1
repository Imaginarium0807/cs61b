notes 
1. java is a language which considers classes very importance, in fact all code must live in a class
2. java is a language which forces you to be objected-oriented  so need to define the class
3. Before java variables can be used, they must be declared.
4. java varialbes must have specific type
5. java varialbe types can never change. 
6. Types are verificed before the code ven runs

### hellow world

public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Prints "Hello, World" to the terminal window.
        System.out.println("Hello, World");
    }

}

### Static Typing

public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int x = 0;
        x = 0;
               while (x < 10){
                  System.out.println(x);
                  x = x + 1;
               }
    }
}    
    
## Declaring functions
public class LargerDemo {
    public static int larger(int x, int y) {
        if (x > y) {
            return x;
        }
        return y;
    }
    public static void main(String[] args){
        System.out.println(larger(-5, 10));
    }
}

/*
1. Functions must be declared as part of a class in Java
    A function that is part of class is called a method.
    So in Java, all functions are methods
2. To define a function in Java, we use public static. we will see alternate way of defining functions later.
3. All parameters of a function must have declared type, and the return value of the function must have declared type.
    Functions in Java return only one value!
